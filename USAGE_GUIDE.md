## Configuration

1. **Get Your TestRail Credentials**
   - Your TestRail instance URL (e.g., https://afterpay.testrail.io)
   - Your email address
   - Your TestRail password or API key

2. **Configure the Extension**
   ```yaml
   testrail:
     base_url: https://afterpay.testrail.io
     username: your-email@example.com
     password: your-api-key
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Export Failed and Blocked Tests to Google Sheet
```python
# First, get your test run ID from TestRail URL
# Example: https://afterpay.testrail.io/index.php?/runs/view/15644
# Run ID is 15644

# Initialize client
client = TestRailClient(
    base_url='https://afterpay.testrail.io',
    username='your-email@example.com',
    password='your-api-key'
)

# Get failed and blocked tests
results = get_failed_and_blocked(run_id=15644)

# Export to Google Sheet
export_to_spreadsheet(
    run_id=15644,
    spreadsheet_id="your-google-sheet-id"
)
```

### Example 2: Get Test Run Details
```python
# Get test run information
run = get_run(run_id=15644)
print(f"Test Run: {run['name']}")
print(f"Failed Tests: {run['failed_count']}")
print(f"Blocked Tests: {run['blocked_count']}")
```

### Example 3: Analyze Test Results
```python
# Get all tests from a run
tests = get_tests(run_id=15644)

# Get results for a specific test
test_results = get_results_for_test(test_id=tests[0]['id'])
```

## Common Tasks

### Task 1: Export Test Results to SAT Spreadsheet
1. Get your TestRail run ID from the URL
2. Get your Google Sheet ID from the URL
3. Run the following commands:
```python
# In Goose chat, type:
run_id = 15644  # Replace with your run ID
sheet_id = "your-sheet-id"  # Get from Google Sheet URL

results = get_failed_and_blocked(run_id)
export_to_spreadsheet(run_id, sheet_id)
```

### Task 2: Get Test Run Summary
```python
run = get_run(run_id=15644)
print(f"""
Test Run Summary:
----------------
Name: {run['name']}
Total Tests: {run['passed_count'] + run['failed_count'] + run['blocked_count'] + run['untested_count']}
Passed: {run['passed_count']}
Failed: {run['failed_count']}
Blocked: {run['blocked_count']}
Untested: {run['untested_count']}
""")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Authentication Error**
   ```
   Error: Authentication failed
   ```
   Solution:
   - Verify your email and API key are correct
   - Check if your API key has expired
   - Ensure you have access to the TestRail instance

2. **Test Run Not Found**
   ```
   Error: Test run with ID XXX not found
   ```
   Solution:
   - Verify the run ID from the TestRail URL
   - Check if you have access to this test run
   - Ensure the test run hasn't been deleted

3. **Google Sheet Access Error**
   ```
   Error: Unable to access Google Sheet
   ```
   Solution:
   - Verify the sheet ID
   - Check if you have edit access to the sheet
   - Ensure the Google Sheets integration is enabled

## Best Practices

   - Regularly rotate your API keys
   - Never share your API keys

2. **Exporting Results**

   - Double-check the Google Sheet ID
   - Review the exported data for accuracy
